    <h2>The Institute</h2>
    <p>
      The Institute for Signature Reduction (ISR) is an independent 501(c)(3)
      nonprofit charitable organization dedicated to advancing education, research,
      and training in digital force protection, cyber privacy, and signature reduction.
    </p>

    <h2>Mission & Scope</h2>
    <p>
      The Institute for Signature Reduction (ISR) is dedicated to advancing
      doctrinal understanding, education, research, and long-term institutional
      stewardship of signature reduction within the contemporary context of
      irregular warfare and strategic competition.
    </p>
    <p>
      ISR supports exploration of ways in which human-centered doctrine for
      managing physical and digital detectability can contribute to broader
      institutional and academic study of irregular warfare, freedom of
      maneuver, and operational effectiveness in complex strategic environments.
      Engagement and insight from practitioners inform ISR’s work, which serves
      academia, defense research communities, and institutions seeking durable
      conceptual frameworks in these domains.
    </p>
    <p>
      A separate for-profit partner organization delivers applied training and
      services, while ISR remains responsible for doctrine development, education,
      research, and the stewardship of associated intellectual property.
    </p>
