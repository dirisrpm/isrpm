    <h2>The Institute</h2>
    <p>
      The Institute for Signature Reduction (ISR) is an independent 501(c)(3)
      nonprofit charitable organization dedicated to advancing education, research,
      and training in digital force protection, cyber privacy, and signature reduction.
    </p>

    <h2>Mission & Scope</h2>
    <p>
      The Institute for Signature Reduction (ISR) is dedicated to advancing
      doctrinal understanding, education, research, and long-term institutional
      stewardship of signature reduction within the contemporary context of
      irregular warfare and strategic competition.
    </p>
    <p>
      ISR supports exploration of ways in which human-centered doctrine for
      managing physical and digital detectability can contribute to broader
      institutional and academic study of irregular warfare, freedom of
      maneuver, and operational effectiveness in complex strategic environments.
      Engagement and insight from practitioners inform ISR’s work, which serves
      academia, defense research communities, and institutions seeking durable
      conceptual frameworks in these domains.
    </p>
    <p>
      A separate for-profit partner organization delivers applied training and
      services, while ISR remains responsible for doctrine development, education,
      research, and the stewardship of associated intellectual property.
    </p>

    <h2>Governance</h2>
    <p>
      ISR is governed in accordance with applicable federal and state nonprofit
      regulations. The Institute maintains independent oversight of its educational
      mission, research activities, and intellectual property, ensuring ethical
      conduct, professional standards, and compliance with all relevant laws and
      policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Partner With Us</h2>
    <p>
      ISR collaborates with professionals, academic institutions, and organizations
      in related fields to share best practices and advance the state of knowledge.
      All engagements are conducted professionally, ethically, and in accordance
      with applicable laws and regulations.
